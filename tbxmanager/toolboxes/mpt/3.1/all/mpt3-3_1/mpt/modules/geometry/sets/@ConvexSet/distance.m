%  DESCRIPTION
%  -----------
%     Compute the closest distance between the convex Set and given point xThe
%  approach is based on solving the optimization problem 
%                                                             
%                                  ymin   ||x-y||             
%                                                2            
%                                 s.t.    y in Set            
%     where x  is the given point in the same dimension as the set and y  is the
%  point inside the Set. If the optimization terminated successfully, the output
%  contains the distance ret.d and the points ret.y, ret.x. Otherwise, the output
%  is empty. If the Set is an array of convex sets, the distance and the point y
%  are returned in a cell arrays.
