%  SYNTAX
%  ------
%     
%      s = support(S,x)
%      s = S.support(x)
%    
%  
%  DESCRIPTION
%  -----------
%     Compute the support of the set in the direction given by the point x. The
%  underlying optimization problem to be solved is as follows 
%                                       ymax   x'y            
%                                 s.t.    y in Set            
%     where x  is the point with the desired direction and y  is the point lying
%  inside the convex Set. The support is returned as the optimal value of the
%  objective function  x'y. The dimension of x must be the same as the Set. If an
%  error occurs during by solving the above optimization problem, the support is
%  empty.

%  INPUT
%  -----
%     
%        
%          S Any set derived from ConvexSet class,    
%            e.g. YSet or Polyhedron.                 
%            Class: ConvexSet                         
%          x The point given as real vector in the    
%            same dimension as the ConvexSet.         
%            Class: double                            
%              
%  
%  
%  OUTPUT
%  ------
%     
%        
%          s The support is returned as the optimal   
%            value of the cost function.              
%            Class: double
