%
%  ISADJACENT: Test if a polyhedron shares a facet with another polyhedron. 
%  =========================================================================
%  
%  
%  SYNTAX
%  ------
%     
%      ts = P.isAdjacent(Q)
%      ts = isAdjacent(P,Q)
%      [ts, iP, iQ] = isAdjacent(P,Q,fP,fQ)
%    
%  
%  DESCRIPTION
%  -----------
%     Return true if the polyhedron P  has a facet to facet property with the
%  polyhedron Q. Both polyhedrons must be in H-representation. If they are not, the
%  irredundant H-representation will be computed. Basically, the function tests if
%  polyhedra P  and S  are adjacent by solving LP problem consecutively for each
%  facet. The polyhedra are declared as adjacent if their intersection is of
%  dimension d-1  and if the facet of polyhedron P  is also a facet for the
%  polyhedron S. If you want to test just specific facets, you can provide them in
%  fP and fQ arguments.
